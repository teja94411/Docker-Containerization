# About

This project features a full-stack web application using Docker for containerization and Jenkins for CI/CD automation. The frontend is served by Nginx, while the backend is powered by a Python Flask API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database. The project utilizes a custom Docker network and a persistent volume for database storage. Jenkins automates the build and deployment process, ensuring smooth integration
between the components. The solution demonstrates seamless deployment, networking, and persistent data management in a containerized environment.
